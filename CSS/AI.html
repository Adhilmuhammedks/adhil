    <h4 style="color: aliceblue;">At its simplest form, artificial intelligence is a field, which combines computer science and robust datasets, to enable problem-solving. It also encompasses sub-fields of machine learning and deep learning, which are frequently mentioned in conjunction with artificial intelligence. These disciplines are comprised of AI algorithms which seek to create expert systems which make predictions or classifications based on input data.
        

        Over the years, artificial intelligence has gone through many cycles of hype, but even to
        skeptics, the release of OpenAI’s ChatGPT seems to mark a turning point. The last time generative AI loomed this large, the breakthroughs were in computer vision, but now the leap forward is in natural language processing. <p>And it’s not just language: Generative models can also learn the grammar of software code, molecules, natural images, and a variety of other data types.The applications for this technology are growing every day, and we’re just starting to
        explore the possibilities. But as the hype around the use of AI in business takes off,
        conversations around ethics become critically important.</p> To read more on where IBM stands within the conversation around AI ethics. <a href="http://127.0.0.1:5500/AI.html"><mark>click here to know more</mark> </a></h4>
